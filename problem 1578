🔹 Problem: Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful
🔹 Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/
🔹 Level: Medium

🧠 Approach:
We must remove balloons so that no two adjacent have the same color.
To minimize total time, always remove the balloon with smaller `neededTime`
whenever two adjacent colors match.

Steps:
1️⃣ Traverse through the string.
2️⃣ If colors[i] == colors[i+1]:
    - Add min(neededTime[i], neededTime[i+1]) to total cost.
    - Keep the balloon with larger time for future comparison.
3️⃣ Return the total minimum time.

🧩 Example:
Input:
  colors = "abaac"
  neededTime = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output:
  3

🔹 Explanation:
We remove the 3-cost balloon (3rd index) since the next one (4) is larger.
Total = 3

⏱️ Time Complexity: O(n)
💾 Space Complexity: O(1)
